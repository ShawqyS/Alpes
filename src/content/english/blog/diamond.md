The Diamond Pattern offers an attractive and distinctive style that will model the products of ham or poultry in a natural and consistent figure, giving a natural appearance of poultry skin.

The production of smoked or roasted turkey breast can be done in a single filling / stuffing and cooking process incorporating liquid smoke or browning agent.

An attractive golden color is the result of this process, the reduction of cooking times, labor savings and improved performance are the result of the elimination of smoking to a single cooking process.

> Ideal for poultry products, ham and honey glazed ham.

# Recommended Stuffing Size Before Processing
